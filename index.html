<div class="about" >
    <h2 class="h2" >About canSAS</h2>
    <p>The collective action for nomadic small angle scatterers (canSAS) is an ongoing activity to provide the small-angle scattering user community with shared tools and information.
    </p>
    <p>This work involves both users and facilities and currently includes:
      <br/>
    </p>

    <ul class="list" >
      <li>Providing access to information about small angle scattering</li>
      <li>Providing information about SAS facilities</li>
      <li>Providing forum for discussions regarding reliablity of data, analysis, uncertainty estimates, and intertpretation</li>
      <li>Working with reference samples to allow comparison of instruments and better understand reliability issues</li>
      <li>Proposing and agreeing common reduced data formats</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The use of both neutrons and X-rays is widespread and co-operation between these facilities and the user community has been fostered by working groups that address specific fields.

  <h2 class="h2" >Meetings and Working Groups</h2>

  <div class="wgtext" >
    Meetings  are held every couple of years or as a need arises. The style varies between working meetings and more traditional conferences.<br/>
    More information about the meetings and working groups can be found on our <a href="https://wiki.cansas.org" >wiki</a>
  </div>

  <div class="wgheader" >Reproducibility &amp; Reliability</div>
  <div class="wgtext" >
    The reproducibility and reliability working group has arranged round-robin measurements of samples as calibrants and to compare results. There is also ongoing discussion about handling different sources of error in SAS data (e.g. systematic vs statistical).
  </div>

  <div class="wgheader" >Data Formats</div>
  <div class="wgtext" >
    For easy exchange of data from multiple facilities, and to meet possible data deposition requirements, the data formats working group has developed formats for <a href="https://www.cansas.org/formats/canSAS1d/1.1/doc/" >1-dimensional reduced data</a> and <a href="https://www.cansas.org/canSAS2012/" >multi-dimensional reduced data</a>
    </br>
    As of early 2017, for new work, it is recommended to use the NXcanSAS (multi-dimensional) standard for both 1-D and n-D data to maximize the chance that other software will be able to read your data files.
  </div>

  <div class="wgheader" >SAS Information</div>
  <div class="wgtext" >
    The group on SAS information and education has been working with the IUCR SAS Commission to develop a web portal for small angle scattering. This is found at <a href="http://www.smallangle.org/" >www.smallangle.org</a>
  </div>

  <div class="wgheader" >Grazing Incidence</div>
  <div class="wgtext" >
    The Grazing Incidence Working group discusses issues related to developing standards and methods for the use of grazing incidence small angle scattering
