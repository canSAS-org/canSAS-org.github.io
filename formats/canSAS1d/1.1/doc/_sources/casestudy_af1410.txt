Case Study: AF1410 Steel
================================

.. note:: This case study has not yet been written up. 

data file: :download:`cs_af1410.xml<../../examples/cs_af1410.xml>`

The data file contains multiple :ref:`SASentry` elements that pertain to different samples
treated at different conditions in a time series.  Each *SASentry* element contains two
:ref:`SASdata` sections that correspond to sector averages from the two-dimensional SANS
data.  Since the samples had been subjected to a 1.6T magnetic field to clear
the scattering from magnetic domain boundaries in one direction, the sector average
for that direction has scattering dominated by purely nuclear scattering moments.  The
other *SASdata* section has scattering due to both nuclear and magnetic scattering moments.
