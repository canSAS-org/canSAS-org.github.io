.. index:: cansas1d:1.1 standard

This is a tutorial for *cansas1d:1.1*,
the canSAS standard format for storing small-angle
scattering data in XML files.

At present, the tutorial section consists of two case studies 
(see the :ref:`case.studies` section), which can serve as examples.  
The opportunity could not be more ripe for a better tutorial.
