.. canSAS 1-D Data Format, v1.1

.. index:: ! canSAS

The name **canSAS** stands for 
*Collective Action for Nomadic Small-Angle Scatterers*.
canSAS provides a forum for users, software developers and facility staff to meet 
and exchange ideas on all aspects of programming for X-ray and neutron small-angle 
scattering experiments. This includes experiment preparation and simulation through 
control to data-storage, reduction and analysis. The aim of the forum is to provide 
the best resources to the many nomadic experimenters who combine results measured at 
different facilities.

The aims of the canSAS meetings are to promote and simplify sharing SAS data 
analysis methods. Non-specialists will benefit from easily applicable methods 
for exchanging and merging of data from different synchrotron, laboratory 
and neutron facilities.

The canonical name for this format is *cansas1d/1.1*.
This  work is the initiative of the canSAS 1D Data Formats Working Group, 
established at the canSAS-V workshop, NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 
USA from October 29th to 31st 2007, which produced revision 1.0.
A further workshop was held July 28th to 31st, 2012 at Uppsala University, 
Uppsala, Sweden which produced revision 1.1.
The format derives many of its foundations
from previous works such as the SASXML format, a joint collaboration
between ISIS and ILL.  

The home page of the canSAS 1D Data Formats Working Group 
describes the members, timelines, and current status.
There is a discussion page for some matters that preceded this revision.
