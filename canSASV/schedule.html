The workshop's aim is to foster discussion about, and develop action plans to address, the issues 
affecting the nomadic small angle scatterer.<p>
As such, each session will consist of a number of short (< 20min) talks followed by a Q&A period. 
There will be a number of themed moderated open discussions, during which time there will be opportunity 
for participants to make short (< 5mins) addresses to the group. <p>

The schedule laid out below is tentative and, given the nature of this workshop, is 
subject to change to suit the development of the meeting.<p>
