Abstract submission and conference registration are now closed. If you wish to attend the conference please contact the organizers (<a href="mailto:cansasv-info@smallangles.net">cansasv-info@smallangles.net</a>).
<p>
<strong>!! 28 October: <a href="schedule.html">The schedule</a> has been updated !!</strong><p>
<strong>!! The finalized information package for the workshop is <a href="cansasV-package.pdf">now available</a> !! </strong>. Paper copies will be provided on your arrival.
<p>
The meeting is being held in the Advanced Measurement Laboratory (AML, Building 215) at NIST Gaithersburg Campus. The information package contains a map and directions.

CanSAS-V will take place at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA. NIST is home to the NIST Center for Neutron Research.
<p>
CanSAS-V is aimed at anyone with a particular interest in the use and application of Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) techniques; e.g., Instrument/Beam line Scientists, Frequent SAS Users, SAS Beam line Software Developers, Facility/Third-party Software Developers (particularly those involved with data file formats, instrument/sample environment control).
<p>
CanSAS is a "self-help network" whose original stated aim was to promote and simplify the sharing of Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) data - be it light, X-ray or neutron - between Facilities and between Users, but its interests now also encompass the discussion and evaluation of emerging (principally software) technologies and the recommendation of "best practice" (where feasible) in pursuit of this aim. If you want to know more, follow the link to the canSAS web site at the bottom of this page.
